    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I have made parfaits for years. Yogurt, and fruit, fruit, and yogurt. Boring! No gains! This recipe 
        has been evolving for a long time. Here's what we got so far. You can basically add in what you want 
        and what you got, but there are some ~life hacks~ that we've compiled to make it better, so do what 
        you can and get them gains baby. Greek yogurt, peanut butter, and mixed in protein powder are all 
        good for protein. Adding fruit, granola, rainsins, and honey make it taste better, and the supplements like chia, flax, 
        collagen, and creatine all help with nutrition.
