    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This mushroom pasta recipe was inspired by Budget Bytes' "One Pot Creamy Mushroom Pasta" recipe. I love to make 
        this recipe when I am craving something creamy and something carby. While I may usually gravitate towards mac 
        and cheese or ramen, what sets this recipe apart is the feeling that I would pay for it at an italian restaurant, 
        so when I am trying to not embarrass myself in front of guests, granted that they can stand mushrooms, I often 
        make this. Be prepared to be in a delicious food coma after you eat the whole thing!
