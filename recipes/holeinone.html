    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My mom used to make this for me on the weekends as a kid. So, now
        I make it for me and my boyfriend whenever I want! It is very simple
        but perfect for adding lots of sauces and getting in some nutrition,
        depending on what kind of bread you use and what else you pair it with.
        For some added protein, pair this with my Muscle Mommy Yogurt recipe!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>Bread (2 slices per person, I prefer whole grain, but sourdough is a tasty second)</li>
        <li>Eggs (2 per person)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Sauce(s) you want as a topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat large pan/skillet over medium-high heat with olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>Use a cup with a 2.5-4" diameter, depending on how big your bread is, to cookie-cutter-out circles from the middle of the bread</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add in 2 slices of bread (not the circle yet)</li>
        <li>Crack one egg into the hole of each slice in the pan</li>
        <li>Take the circles and dunk each side into the egg, coating it in the egg white, and then putting them in the pan to cook with the bread</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper on the slices and circles while they cook</li>
        <li>Once the bottom is cooked and the top is no longer runny, flip and season the other side</li>
        <li>Serve hot and with your favorite sauces</li>
    </ol>
